## Outline

What we want:
* connect devices to internet securely through unsecure access points
* powered by laptop
* small form factor
* affordable
* integrated VPN

What We Want To Do:
* Own our data. ISP should be a simple pipe, but bad actors monitor what I do, what YOU do, what WE ALL do to a significant extent
* Minimize risk associated with using unknown access points and untrusted ISPs
* Support open source projects because they are auditable, meaning you can actually see the code and understand how it works.
* Support internet privacy. We care about our privacy, the privacy of our family and friends, and we care about your privacy too. This is why we chose cookie-free analytics; we don't care who you are, we are only interested in how our site gets used so we can improve our user experience. Product-led growth results in a better experience for everyone.

Benefits:
* Secure internet access
* No man-in-the-middle attack route
* No sniffing (might still be able to do it but encrypted data would be unintelligible)
* Eavesdroppers would not be permitted secure access to the remote private network on far end of VPN connection (home, work, AWS, etc)
* of note: HTTPS on public WiFi protects me from you knowing what I'm doing on Facebook, but you would still know that I connected to Facebook.

GL-iNet Beryl (GL-MT1300)
* Small
* Powerful
* User-friendly open source firmware
* Affordable price point
* Powered by USB-C cable
* Great documenation. Easy initial setup.
* Integrated open source VPN support.

Our Views On Privacy
* You use our product. We use cookie-free analytics about <em>how</em> you use our product as part of a feedback loop to <em>improve</em> our product.
* We understand that you may wish to <em>opt out</em> of our analytics, but because <em>we do not collect any personally identifiable information</em>, we do not believe that our analytics should be opt-in by default.
* We will not profit from your data; we are not data brokers.
* Anonymizing data is critical. We believe it is the only ethical way for a privacy-conscious company to employ usage data to improve their product.
* It is intrusive and unacceptable to track someone across the web, but we believe watching how you use our site is fair game. A bad, but useful, analogy: A guy watching you walk around the mall, noting which stores you visit and what you purchase where is creepy as fuck. The independent bookstore owner who notes which sections/shelves his customers frequent and how they move around in his store simply wants to optimize his layout so that each customer enjoys their experience.
