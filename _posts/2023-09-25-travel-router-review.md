## Outline

What we want:
* connect devices to internet securely through unsecure access points
* powered by laptop
* small form factor
* affordable
* integrated VPN

Benefits:
* Secure internet access
* No man-in-the-middle attack route
* No sniffing (might still be able to do it but encrypted data would be unintelligible)
* Eavesdroppers would not be permitted secure access to the remote private network on far end of VPN connection (home, work, AWS, etc)
