### Getting Your Shit Together with Cloaked: Online Privacy for the People Who Give a Fuck

Alright, listen the fuck up. If you've had your personal data splattered across the internet like a shitty Jackson Pollock painting, found your bank account drained by some asshole, or just woke up to the fact that your online privacy is as nonexistent as a vegan option at a barbecue joint, then it's high time to buckle up and take this shit seriously.

Maybe you're glued to your damn screen all day and haven't thought twice about digital security. Or perhaps you're that tech-savvy badass who's always fixing everyone's bullshit tech problems (like why the fuck isn't Spotify playing in the headphones – hint: it's the goddamn Bluetooth; turn it on and pair that bad boy up). Whatever your deal, you're in the right place.

Let's lay it out straight: Online privacy is fucked. But instead of crying into your beer, let's turn your anxiety into some kick-ass action. Here's a no-bullshit guide to locking down your digital life and taking control of your digital footprint. No more half-assed measures; we're going balls to the wall.

### Your Privacy Toolkit: Arm Yourself, Motherfucker! We Are Dropping Knowledge

## Strong-Ass Passwords: The Bedrock of Your Online Privacy

Let's break it down: in this digital jungle, strong passwords aren't just a good idea; they're the fucking foundation of your online privacy. It's the 21st century, and while we're not living in a sci-fi movie with retina scanners at every turn, strong passwords are the best damn system we've got to keep our digital lives locked down tight.

In a world where your online privacy can be shattered faster than your grandma's china, a strong-ass password isn't just your first line of defense; it's your most reliable one. It’s like having an unbreakable shield in a battle; without it, you’re just a sitting duck in a pond full of hackers.

Think of each password like a fucking fortress guarding your precious treasure (aka your personal data). Make it long, make it complex, and for the love of god, make it unique. Why? Because if one password gets compromised, you don't want that shitshow to spread. Unique passwords mean a breach in one place doesn’t turn into a fucking free-for-all for hackers across all your accounts.  Mix in upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols – create a goddamn enigma. And don’t you dare reuse them across sites. A password manager isn't just a nice-to-have; it's your digital bodyguard. [1Password] (<https://1password.com/>) or [ProtonPass] (<https://proton.me/pass/>) will keep all of these complex passwords in line, and they make changing compromised passwords easy-peasy.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - The “Dalton” of Your Roadhouse Digital Club

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) isn't just some fancy tech jargon; it's like having a beefy bouncer checking IDs at your digital door. It's your second, ironclad "fuck off" to any wannabe hackers trying to crash your online party. And here's the kicker: even if some sneaky bastard gets their grubby hands on your password, MFA means they're still screwed. It's like having a backup bouncer who says, "Nice try, but no dice."

Sure, authentication apps do a decent enough job, and are a better option than text messages, but if you want to roll out the red carpet for security, physical keys like YubiKey (yubico.com) are where it's at. These bad boys are the real VIPs, turning your accounts into a fortress that's impenetrable as a bank vault. And Cloaked’s integrated MFA? That shit's smoother than a whiskey neat and tougher than a two-dollar steak.

## Fake Answers for Security Questions: Time to Bullshit Like a Boss

Those "security" questions are a goddamn farce. What’s your mother's maiden name? The name of your first pet? Please.  Any half-assed hacker with internet access could dig up that crap before you can say "identity theft." Here's a pro tip most folks don't think about: lie your ass off. Get wild with it. Your first pet? Oh, it was a dragon named Fluffykins the Destroyer. Your mom's maiden name? Skywalker. Your favorite pet was a unicorn named Sparkle Ass.

And guess what? The best part? You don't need to burden your brain with remembering all these creative fabrications. Your password manager, the unsung hero of your digital life, will keep track of all your fanciful fibs. It's like having a secret diary that logs all your white lies, keeping your real info under wraps and throwing hackers off your scent.

## Unique Emails and Phone Numbers: Your Digital Disguises

If you're still using the same tired-ass email and phone number for all of your accounts, you're basically rolling out the red carpet for all of the data-hungry wankers. It's time to mix it up like a master of disguise. Slap on a different email and phone number for each account like they're fake mustaches and sunglasses. You're not just some basic bitch in the digital world; you're a goddamn chameleon.

Think about it. Unique emails and phone numbers are like wearing different costumes at every party you crash. To sneaky data brokers, like Meta and Alphabet, you’ll look like a whole crowd of different people. It makes it a real bitch for them to connect the dots and link your accounts together. You're not just throwing them off your scent; you're sending them on a wild goose chase.

And hey, services like IronVest (ironvest.com) are cool and all, but you wanna step up your game? Get Cloaked and grab your dagger for this digital spy game. With Cloaked, you're not just another face in the crowd; you're the elusive spy who's always one step ahead.

## Encrypt Your Shit: Lock Down Your Digital Life

If you're not encrypting your devices, you're basically throwing a "Hack Me, Please" party. It's like leaving your front door wide open, with a neon sign blinking "Come on in and take my shit!" Listen up, because this is crucial: Microsoft, Apple, and Google – yeah, the big tech overlords – they all offer full disk encryption for your devices. What the hell are you waiting for? Turn that shit on!

Encrypting your device is like putting everything you own in a badass safe that even the slickest thieves can't crack. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has this dope guide on [encryption] (<https://ssd.eff.org/module/what-should-i-know-about-encryption>). It's not just some boring textbook crap; it's your how-to guide for turning your device into Fort Knox.

The EFF guide lays it out plain and simple: encrypting your data scrambles it so much that anyone who gets their hands on it won't be able to make heads or tails of it without the key. It's like speaking in a secret code that only you and your device understand. And this isn't just for your laptop or desktop; we're talking phones, tablets, even your damn smartwatch – if it stores your personal shit, encrypt it.

So, go ahead and get your digital life locked down. Start today! Turn on that encryption everywhere possible, and give those hackers the middle finger. With your data encrypted, even if they get their grubby hands on your device, all they'll find is a bunch of gibberish. You wouldn't leave your diary open on the kitchen table like a dipshit, right? So don't leave your digital life out in the open either.

## VPN or TOR: Go Fucking Incognito

Browsing without a VPN or TOR is like streaking through your neighborhood – you are exposed, my friend. Everyone can see your business. Time to gear up with a solid VPN, like [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com), that masks your IP with an encrypted tunnel, keeping your online escapades private.

WireGuard is the badass on the block. It's not just some common cloak; it's a sleek, fast, and secure as hell kind of cloak. Imagine cutting through online bullshit like a hot knife through butter. That's WireGuard. It's lightweight, meaning no lag, no endless loading screens – just pure, unadulterated browsing freedom. And it's tight on security, using top-notch cryptography that's harder to crack than a goddamn bois d’arc (bodock) tree.

But hey, if implementing WireGuard feels like overkill, no worries. There are plenty of VPN providers, like Nord (<https://nordvpn.com/>), that incorporate WireGuard and are ready to cover your digital ass. Just do your homework and find a VPN that doesn't suck. WIRED has a few suggestions (wired.com/story/best-vpn/) for you. Or, simply jump on the TOR (<https://www.torproject.org/>) bandwagon for that next-level anonymity.
Remember, cruising the web raw is asking for trouble. So slap on that VPN and browse like a fucking ghost. Invisible, untouchable, and smart as hell. And, please, make sure to cover your ass.

## Encrypted Messaging: Secret Squirrel Shit

Stop letting Big Brother eavesdrop on your chats. Not on [Signal](<https://www.signal.org>) yet? You're basically broadcasting your private convos. This app ain't your average gabfest tool; it's like a steel vault for your messages.

Here's the skinny: Signal's all about that end-to-end encryption life. Your words, your secrets, your random thoughts – they're locked down tighter than a miser's purse. It's just you and the person you're chatting with, no nosy eavesdroppers in between.
And when the bigwigs came sniffing around for user info, Signal had zilch to hand over. Their data cupboard's so bare, they told the feds to take a hike and didn't break a sweat doing it. Read about their epic 'must suck to suck!' moment [right here](<https://www.signal.org/bigbrother/central-california-grand-jury>).

Listen, here's the bottom line: give a damn about your chat privacy? Time to hop on Signal. It's like wrapping your words in digital armor. In the world of online blabber, Signal ain't just playing – they're leading the charge.

## Keep Your Apps in Check

Updating your apps ain't just some tedious chore you keep swiping away. Those updates? They're like patching up holes in your sinking ship of digital security. Ignore that shit, and you're inviting all sorts of online pirates to raid your precious cargo hold and plunder your booty.
And, let’s talk about the fuck-ton of unnecessary apps squatting on your phone. Each one's like a little spy, peeking into your personal life. The more apps you have, the more eyes you've got on your data. Those sneaky bastards can access everything from your location, to your contacts, to your accelerometers, and maybe even your sacred photo gallery. Think about THAT for a minute – no bueno, right?! But that’s our point! Every pointless app is another risk, another data point companies can sell to the highest bidder.

So, for fuck’s sake, embrace a bit of digital minimalism. Cut the dead weight. Delete the apps you don't need. It’s not just about freeing up space; it's about keeping your private life private. Less apps, less leaks, less chances for some corporate perv to make bank off your data. In the world of digital security, less is more – more privacy, more peace of mind, more power to you.

## Shut Down Unknown Callers

Don't let random calls and texts fuck up your day. Unknown caller? Send that shit straight to voicemail. But listen up, 'cause it's not just annoying – it's a sneaky-ass trap and that scammer wants to harsh your mellow. Phishing, smishing, and vishing are like the three stooges of digital scams, each one craftier than the last.

Phishing? That's your classic bullshit email trying to swipe your info. But smishing, that's phishing's sneaky little brother, slinking into your SMS. They'll text you some crap that looks legit, hoping you'll bite. And vishing? That's the smooth talker of the bunch, using voice calls to trick you into spilling your guts.

So what’s the move? [WIRED](<https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-block-calls-and-spam-messages/>)’s got the playbook on blocking calls and locking down those spam messages. It’s your playbook for building a fortress around your phone. Use it. Stay frosty.

## Turn Off Ad Personalization: Kick Creepy Ads to the Curb

Those ads stalking you across the internet? Creepy as hell. Take back your privacy by turning off ad personalization. When you cut these ads off, they lose their smarts. Suddenly, they can't guess your next move or tempt you into impulse buys. It's like watching a spy fumble in the dark – satisfying and damn empowering.

Less data collection also means fewer chances of your personal info getting leaked. Think of it as keeping your digital diary under lock and key. And the bonus? You break free from the echo chamber, opening doors to a wider, more diverse online world.

So, take a leap towards hope and control. Dive into [NPR](<https://www.npr.org/2020/10/09/922262686/>)'s privacy guide and start browsing with confidence. Your online life is yours to command. Keep it that way.

## The Lowdown on Metadata

Listen up, because this shit’s important. Metadata is like your digital DNA – it says a lot about who you are. Don’t ignore it. We'll tear into this beast in a future post, but for now, know it’s big, it’s bad, the NSA and CIA use it to kill people, and it’s on our radar.

Remember, securing your online life isn't a one-and-done deal. It's a fucking lifestyle. Stay alert, stay informed, and treat your digital security like it’s the most precious thing you own – because, in this batshit crazy digital world, it just might be.
